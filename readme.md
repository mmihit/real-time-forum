### <span style="color:pink">Implementation Details

- #### <span style="color:#40E0D0">SQLite
The SQLite database library will be utilized to save data in the forum (including users, posts, comments, etc.).

It is necessary to utilize at least one SELECT, one CREATE, and one INSERT query. To obtain additional details regarding SQLite, one can refer to the SQLite page.

- #### <span style="color:#40E0D0">Authentication
Ask for an email address.

Return an error if the email is already in use.

Ask for a username.

Ask for a password.

The password needs to be encrypted during storage (bonus task).

The forum should confirm whether the supplied email is present in the database and that all credentials are accurate. If the password is incorrect, an error message should be issued.

- #### <span style="color:#40E0D0">Communication
All users, both registered and non-registered, will be able to see the posts and comments, but non-registered users will only have the option to view them.

Only users who are registered can post and comment
